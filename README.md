### Supplementary Material

1. FrUITeR's Event Extractor component is implemented in Java using [Soot]() with 200 SLOC. [source code]()

2. FrUITeR's Accuracy Evaluator and Utility Evaluator are implemented in Python with 800 + ATM's code SLOC. [source code]()

3. The benchmark test cases are implemented in Java with X SLOC. [source code]() 

4. The final dataset of the case study (3 subject apps, 60 test cases, 340 GUI events)

5. Subject apps (Wish, Etsy, Geek) and their ground-truth Canonical Maps  [here]()

6. The re-implementation of ATM and AppFlo


2. The source code for the framework's implementation including different components (e.g., GUI Mapper, Test Processor); and Test Analyzer including ground truth mapping of GUI events to their canonical IDs, can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oMtoWUuzsXuNnOiUjxWEiLuQ25UrHZtW/view).

3. The results of our analysis on over 7,000 test transfer cases with 90 combinations of 10 subject apps (1MB .RData file), along with the .R scripts to analyze different statistics, can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19nXkYnMq03WLmGDXyxIEcZuCpCWPh5uR/view).
